# CurrencyCalculator

This project was created as the final assignment for my Advanced Java course at Valenica College. 
The program is designed for the user to enter a number and calculates that number in the fibonacci sequence.
The concepts used in this program are socket programing and GUI applications.
The program takes the user's input and sends it to the server to be calculated. The client then retrieves the answer from the server and outputs it in the application.
